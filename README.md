## Additional Information
Demo was tested with LÖVE 11.5 and 12.0 (build from 12.04.2025).

The metrics shown (info display) with \* (star) are messured manually, the one without star by framework.

Threaded logic can be enabled with "t" (not listed in info display). It leads to performance drop and shows the impact of copying large amount of data between threads.
